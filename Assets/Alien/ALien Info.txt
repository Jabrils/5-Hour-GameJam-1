ALien and Cocoon models.

A Humunoid rig can be applied to this Alien with Mecanim. It is fully skinned in Maya 2010.
If you would like the original .MA Maya file let me know.

All Textures and Normal maps are 1K PNG except for the tranparency Alpha Map which is a TIF format.

Any Questions or Feedback let me know.

You are free to use these models as you like. 
I only ask if you use it in a working game to leave a link in the User Review section.

ENJOY!!!
